# Venv with Github #

Typically the steps you always take are:
```
git clone <repo>
cd <repo>
pip install virtualenv (if you don't already have virtualenv installed)
virtualenv venv to create your new environment (called 'venv' here)
source venv/bin/activate to enter the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt to install the requirements in the current environment```
